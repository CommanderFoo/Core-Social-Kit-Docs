# Player Pokes - About Component

This component will allow players to poke each other.  This is useful if you want to get another players attention, or maybe even to say "Welcome".  This is a more private system, so other players on the server won't see the poke, only the player you are poking will see it.

The component comes with some default pokes, but you can easily modify / create your own pokes.

There is also a key binding for a player to disable all pokes received to prevent poke spamming, along with a cooldown to prevent players spamming others.

1. Enter player mode in multiplayer mode with at least 2 clients.
2. Press `p` to show / hide the Pokes UI.
	1. Click the player you wish to poke.
	2. Select a poke message from the dropdown.
	3. Click the poke button to the right of the dropdown to send the poke.

Here are a list of the default pokes that come with the component.

| Poke Text |
| --------- |
| Poke! |

| Unlucky |
| Nice one |
| Loot on me |
| Can you help please? |
