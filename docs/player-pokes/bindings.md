# Player Pokes - Key Bindings

Players can press the `p` key by default to open or close the Poke UI.

Here is a list of default key bindings and what they do.  These can easily be changed.

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `p` | This is a toggle.  It will show or hide the Poke UI. |
| `o` | This is a toggle.  Allows players to disable all pokes so no one can poke them. |
