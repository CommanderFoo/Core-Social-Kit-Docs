# Player Markers - Key Bindings

For players to be able to place a marker down at their position, they need to have a key binding to use.  By default this binding is `m` to place and remove their marker.

Here is a list of default key bindings.

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `m` | This is a toggle.  If no marker is down, then a new marker is placed at the location of the player.  Otherwise the marker is removed. |
| `h` | This is a toggle.  This can be used to turn on or off all markers. |
