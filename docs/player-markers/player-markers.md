# Player Markers - About Component

This component will allow players to place a marker down which is visible to all other players.  This is very useful for players to share their location, or maybe the location of loot they found so everyone else can find it easily.

When a marker is placed down it will show up to all other players on the server, and by default will contain a distance to the marker so players can get to that location quickly.  This is really handy if you are playing with friends and want to group up, or if you are a nice person and want to share the location of some awesome loot.

The component comes with various options to customise it, and also has the option for the player to turn all markers off if they wish.
