# Player Callouts - Key Bindings

Different callouts can be set to any key press you like.  By default these are set to 1-9.

Here is a list of default key bindings.

| Key | Text |
| ------- | ---- |
| `1` | Help |
| `2` | Enemies here |
| `3` | I'm down |
| `4` | Yes |
| `5` | No |
| `6` | I need healing |
| `7` | Come here |
| `8` | There is loot here |
| `9` | I love cookies, all kinds of cookies.  Anyone else like cookies? |

Callout `9` is an example of how you can customise the colors of the callout.
