# Player Callouts - Creating Callouts

Creating your own custom callouts is really easy.  Follow the steps below and see the list of options to see how to set and customise your callouts.

1. To be able to create or remove callouts, you need to [deinstance](https://docs.coregames.com/tutorials/template_reference/#deinstance-a-template) the `Social Kit - Callouts` template in your hierarchy.

2. Expand the `Callouts` folder.  In here you will see all the default callouts that come with the component.  You can delete or edit the existing ones, and even add more.

3. A simple way to add more is to just duplicate the `Callout_Data` script and then modify it with your callout data.
